# Code Snippets

**Last Updated:** April 10, 2025

This document collects reusable code patterns, examples, and solutions to common problems encountered in the project. All code snippets adhere to Clean Code principles.

## Clean Code Standards for Snippets

All code snippets in this document must exemplify Clean Code principles:

1. **Clear Intent**: Each snippet should clearly communicate its purpose
2. **Simplicity**: Snippets should use the simplest approach that solves the problem
3. **Proper Naming**: All variables, functions, and classes should have descriptive names
4. **Minimal Comments**: Code should be self-explanatory, with comments explaining only the "why"
5. **Error Handling**: Include appropriate error handling in snippets
6. **Testability**: Where applicable, show how the code can be tested
7. **SOLID Principles**: Demonstrate good design principles
8. **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Avoid duplication in code patterns

When adding new snippets, ensure they adhere to these principles and can serve as exemplars for the project's coding standards.
