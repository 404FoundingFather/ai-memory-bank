# Architectural Decisions

**Last Updated:** April 10, 2025

This document records significant architectural decisions made in the project, providing context, rationale, and consequences for each decision.

## Decision-Making Guidelines

### Clean Code Principles Requirement

All architectural decisions must consider Clean Code principles regardless of programming language or framework. These principles include:

1. **Readability**: Code should be easy to read and understand
2. **Simplicity**: Prefer simple solutions over complex ones
3. **Self-documenting**: Code should explain itself through clear naming and structure
4. **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Avoid duplication in code and knowledge
5. **SOLID Principles**:
   - Single Responsibility Principle
   - Open/Closed Principle  
   - Liskov Substitution Principle
   - Interface Segregation Principle
   - Dependency Inversion Principle
6. **Small Functions/Classes**: Keep functions and classes focused and concise
7. **Meaningful Names**: Use descriptive, intention-revealing names
8. **Minimal Dependencies**: Limit dependencies between components
9. **Error Handling**: Handle errors gracefully and meaningfully
10. **Testability**: Design code to be easily testable

Each architectural decision should explicitly address how it supports or enhances adherence to these principles.

## Decision Record Format

Each architectural decision is documented using the following format:

1. **Title**: A descriptive title that summarizes the decision
2. **Status**: Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, or Superseded
3. **Context**: The problem or situation that necessitated the decision
4. **Decision**: The specific architectural choice that was made
5. **Consequences**: The resulting outcomes, both positive and negative
6. **Alternatives Considered**: Other options that were evaluated
7. **References**: Any supporting documentation or external influences
