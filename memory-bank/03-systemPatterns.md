# System Patterns

**Last Updated:** [Current Date]

This document describes the architecture, design patterns, and code organization principles used in the project.

## Architecture Overview

[Provide a high-level description of the system architecture here]

### Core Components
* [Component 1] - [Purpose]
* [Component 2] - [Purpose]
* [Component 3] - [Purpose]

### Component Interactions
[Describe how the major components interact with each other]

## Design Patterns

### [Pattern Name 1]
* **Purpose**: [Why this pattern is used]
* **Implementation**: [How it's implemented in the project]
* **Key Classes/Components**: [Where to find it]

### [Pattern Name 2]
* **Purpose**: [Why this pattern is used]
* **Implementation**: [How it's implemented in the project]
* **Key Classes/Components**: [Where to find it]

### [Pattern Name 3]
* **Purpose**: [Why this pattern is used]
* **Implementation**: [How it's implemented in the project]
* **Key Classes/Components**: [Where to find it]

## Code Organization

### Directory Structure
```
[Project Root]
├── [Directory 1] - [Purpose]
├── [Directory 2] - [Purpose]
│   ├── [Subdirectory] - [Purpose]
│   └── [Subdirectory] - [Purpose]
└── [Directory 3] - [Purpose]
```

### Module Responsibilities
* **[Module/Directory Name]**: [Responsibility]
* **[Module/Directory Name]**: [Responsibility]
* **[Module/Directory Name]**: [Responsibility]
